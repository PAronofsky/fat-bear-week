            Every year Katmai National Park runs a "Fat Bear Week" competition.
            To get ready for hibernation during the long, cold winter, bears need to bulk up in preparation.
            This provides an excellent opportunity for some good competitive fun!
            Brackets are released Monday, October 3, 7 p.m. Eastern / 4p.m. Pacific, and the competition runs from October 5 - October 11.
